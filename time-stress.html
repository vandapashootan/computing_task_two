      <h2>Stress Management</h2>
      <p> 
        Stress management involves using various techniques and coping strategies to manage your overall stress levels, improve how you react to stressful things in your life, and build resilience. Managing stress is all about taking charge: of your thoughts, emotions, schedule, environment, and the way you deal with problems. Stress management starts with identifying the sources of stress in your life. People can simply overlook how their own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors contribute to their everyday stress levels. However, learning about yourself is the key to coping with stress. <br>
        <br>
        — Keep a stress journal. <br>
        A stress journal can help you identify the regular stressors in your life and the way you deal with them. Each time you feel stressed, make a note of it in your journal or use a stress tracker on your phone. <br>
        <br>
        — Replace unhealthy coping strategies with healthy ones. <br>
        Think about the ways you currently manage and cope with stress in your life. Your stress journal can help you identify them. <br>
        <br>
        — Practice the 4 As of stress management <br>
        There are many healthy ways to reduce stress or cope with its effects, but they all require change. You can either change the situation or change your reaction. When deciding which option to choose, it’s helpful to think of the four As: avoid, alter, accept, or adapt. <br>

      <h2>Calming Tips</h2>
      <p> 1. Take deep breaths <br>
        Shallow breathing is a classic stress reaction, so taking deep breaths to slow down your breathing will have the opposite affect and help you to stay calm. <br>
        <br>
        2. Take a break <br>
        A good way to stop a situation stressing you out is to distance yourself from it. If you can, move into a different space to your source of stress – even if that means locking yourself in the bathroom for a couple of minutes. <br>
        <br>
        3. Untense your muscles <br>
        You might not even notice you’re doing it, but muscles tense up when we’re stressed. Take a moment to notice this in your body, and start to reverse this – it could be by unclenching your fists or lowering your shoulders. <br>
        <br>
        4. Stretch your body <br>
        Stretching out is a great way to relax your muscles and calm your mind. <br>
        <br>
        5. Have a chat <br>
        Feeling connected with friends is a great way to help you stay calm*. Even if you can’t get together in person, a phone call, instant messages or video chat can do just as much good. <br>
        <br>
        6. Watch something funny <br>
        It’s hard to stay anxious when you’re laughing. Whether it’s clips of your kids, your favourite comedian or pets doing daft things, a good laugh can increase endorphins and soothe tension, and so help you to stay calm. <br>
        <br>
        7. Challenge your thoughts <br>
        How you think can have an impact on how you feel, and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is based on how changing these thoughts can help you to calm down and change particular behaviours. <br>
        <br>
        8. Avoid unhealthy habits <br>
        It might be tempting to rely on different crutches to help you cope and calm down, but things like alcohol, caffeine and smoking won’t help in the long run. In fact, they could make it even harder to deal with the real issues. It’s better to tackle the source of your stress head-on. <br>
        <br>
        9. Write it down <br>
        A great way of getting difficult thoughts and feelings out of your system is by writing them down. Forget about spelling, grammar and punctuation – no one else is going to read this. Not only will the act of writing calm you, but it will help clear your head and could even help you to think of other coping strategies that will help you stay calm.</p>
