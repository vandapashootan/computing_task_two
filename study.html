      <h2>Quick Tips</h2>
      <p> 1. Time Management <br>
        <br>
        Good time management allows students to plan their studying and balance activities, homework, hobbies, and social life. Key strategies include: <br>
        <br>
        — Using a Planner : Write down all assignments, exams, and due dates in order to stay organized. <br>
        — Setting Priorities : Focus on the most important tasks first, and break large assingments into small steps. <br>
        — Creating a Study Schedule : Dedicate specific time slots for studying each day and stick to the routine. <br>
        <br> 
        2. Active Reading <br>
       <br>
        Active reading is more than just going through the material. Most fundamentally, it is about engaging with the text to improve comprehension. Techniques include: <br>
        <br>
        — Highlighting Key Points : Focus on important facts or concepts while reading. <br>
        — Summarizing : Write short summaries in your own words to reinforce understanding. <br>
        — Asking Questions : Make questions as you read to stay engaged and critically think about the material. <br>
        <br>
        3. Note-Taking <br>
        <br>
        Effective note-taking helps students keep information and is an essential study tool. Some popular methods are: <br>
        <br>
        — The Cornell Method : Divide the page into sections for notes, key points, and summaries. <br>
        — Mind Mapping : Visual diagrams represent ideas and concepts, which is perfect for visual learners. <br>
        — Bullet Points and Lists : Simple and quick, making it easier to review key concepts. <br>
        <br>
        4. Test Preparation <br>
        <br>
        Preparing for exams requires a strategic approach to studying. Some tips include: <br>
        <br>
        — Practice Tests and Past Papers : Familiarize yourself with the format and types of questions. <br>
        — Reviewing Notes Regularly : Instead of cramming, go over notes consistently. <br>
        — Study Groups :  Collaborating with peers can help clarify confusing topics and make studying more interactive. <br>
        <br>
        5. Memory Techniques <br>
        <br>
        Memory plays a crucial role in retaining information. Try techniques such as: <br>
        — Mnemonics : Create acronyms or phrases to remember lists or processes. <br>
        — Chunking : Break down information into smaller, manageable pieces. <br>
        — Visualization : Create mental images of concepts to aid memory. <br>
